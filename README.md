# Book-store
The Book Store project is a full-stack web application designed to manage a collection of books. Built with React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend, this project provides users with the ability to view, add, update, and delete books. MongoDB is used for data storage, and Axios handles HTTP requests.
